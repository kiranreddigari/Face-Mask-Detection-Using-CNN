# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN

Dataset(with and without masks):
--https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data


--step1 : 1.0 Preprocessing
--preprocessing the data and save data.npy and target.npy files.

--step2: 2.0 Training with CNN
--I do my training in Google Colab and you can save model/weights, for me model didn't load so i downloaded weights.
--It downloads best model which has less validation loss by using keras checkpoints

--step3: 3.0 Detecting Masks
--here i provided for both webcam and manual images
